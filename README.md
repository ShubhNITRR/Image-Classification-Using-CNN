# Image-Classification-Using-CNN

# Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of this project is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

# Requirements
Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib

 # Dataset
Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from CIFAR-10 and extract the contents into the data directory.
